      Bionformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops
      methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially
      when the data sets are large and complex. The author of essential
      bioinformatics is Jin Xiong. The term bioinformatics is coined 
      by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970. Structural bioinformatics
      is the branch of bioinformatics that is related
      to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of
      biological macromolecules such as protein, RNA and DNA.
      In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the
      sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identif regions of similarity that
      may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary
      relationships between sequences.

      The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of 
               biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches is its
      focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to
               achieve this goal. Examples include: pattern recognition, data mining,
               machine learning algorithms, and visualization. Major research
      efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding,
               genome assembly, drug design, drug discovery, protein structure
               alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene
               expression and proteinâ€“protein interactions, genome-wide
               association studies, the modeling of evolution and cell division/mitosis.
      Bioinformatics entails the creation and advancement of databases,
               algorithms, computational and statistical techniques,
               and theory to solve formal and practical problems
      arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

      Structural bioinformatics is a branch of bioinformatics which
      deals with generalizations about macromolecular 3D structures
               such as comparisons of overall folds and local motifs,
               principles of molecular folding, evolution, binding interactions,
               and structure/function relationships, working both
              from experimentally solved structures and from computational
              models.

      In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging
      the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions
      of similarity that may be a consequence of functional,
      structural, or evolutionary relationships between the
      sequences. Aligned sequences of nucleotide or amino acid
      residues are typically represented as rows within
      a matrix. Gaps are inserted between the residues so
      that identical or similar characters are aligned in
      successive columns. Sequence alignments are also used
      for non-biological sequences such as calculating the
      distance cost between strings in a natural language,
      or to display financial data.
