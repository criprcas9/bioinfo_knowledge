      **Bionformatics** is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops
      methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially
      when the data sets are large and complex. The author of essential
      bioinformatics is Jin Xiong. The term bioinformatics is coined 
      by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970. Structural bioinformatics
      is the branch of bioinformatics that is related
      to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of
      biological macromolecules such as protein, RNA and DNA.
      In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the
      sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identif regions of similarity that
      may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary
      relationships between sequences.
