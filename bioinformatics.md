# Bioinformatics Overview

**Bioinformatics** is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially when the data sets are large and complex. The author of essential bioinformatics is Jin Xiong. The term bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970.

## Structural Bioinformatics

Structural bioinformatics is the branch of bioinformatics that is related to the analysis and prediction of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules such as proteins, RNA, and DNA.

## Sequence Alignment

In bioinformatics, a sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity that may be a consequence of functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships between sequences.

## Role in Biological Data Analysis

Bioinformatics and computational biology involve the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the Human Genome Project and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology. 

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. These techniques include:
- Pattern recognition
- Data mining
- Machine learning algorithms
- Visualization

## Major Research Areas

Major research efforts in the field include:
- Sequence alignment
- Gene finding
- Genome assembly
- Drug design and discovery
- Protein structure alignment
- Protein structure prediction
- Prediction of gene expression and proteinâ€“protein interactions
- Genome-wide association studies
- Modeling of evolution and cell division/mitosis

## Advancements in Computational Techniques

Bioinformatics entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

## Structural Bioinformatics in Detail

Structural bioinformatics is a branch of bioinformatics that deals with generalizations about macromolecular 3D structures such as comparisons of overall folds and local motifs, principles of molecular folding, evolution, binding interactions, and structure/function relationships, working both from experimentally solved structures and from computational models.

## Sequence Alignment in Practice

Aligned sequences of nucleotide or amino acid residues are typically represented as rows within a matrix. Gaps are inserted between the residues so that identical or similar characters are aligned in successive columns. Sequence alignments are also used for non-biological sequences such as calculating the distance cost between strings in a natural language, or to display financial data.
